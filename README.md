---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (recent stable version)
- JDK 11
- A Firebase project with **Authentication** and **Cloud Firestore** enabled

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
   \```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Laxika220/cabSharing.git
   cd cabSharing
   \```

2. **Firebase config**
   The app expects a `google-services.json` file in the `app/` directory, generated from your own Firebase project (register an Android app with package name `com.example.cabsharing`). This file is required for Auth and Firestore to work.

3. **Open in Android Studio**
   Open the project root and let Gradle sync.

4. **Run**
   Build and run on an emulator or device (minSdk 24+), or from the command line:
   \```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   \```

---

## Permissions

- `INTERNET` — required for Firebase Authentication and Firestore sync

---

## Roadmap / Ideas

- [ ] Push notifications on match
- [ ] In-app chat between matched riders
- [ ] Ride history
- [ ] Report/verify system for user safety
